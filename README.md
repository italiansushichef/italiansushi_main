Data Set for Matchup Generator
----
Using the Riot Developmental API, we collected ~11,000 ranked players from the Plat-Diamond range and ~50,000 of their unique ranked SR matches. Due to GitHub repo limits, we currently only use a smaller set of ~5000 matches to generate lane matchups. In the future (after competition) this will be increased, which should also provide better matchup results.
